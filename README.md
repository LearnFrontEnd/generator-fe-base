> A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for scaffolding out a simple front-end project


## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension. In our case, we're creating a simple front-end project with an `index.html`, CSS, and JavaScript file.

To install generator-fe-base from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-fe-base
```

Finally, initiate the generator in an empty directory:

```bash
yo fe-base
```
