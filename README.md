# generator-fe-base [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/learnfrontend/generator-learnfe-base.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ascott1/generator-learnfe-base)

> A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for scaffolding out a simple front-end project


## Requirements

Yeoman generators require that [Node](https://nodejs.org/) be installed on your machine.

## Installation

To use the `learnfe` generator, you will need to install Yeoman and the generator itself:

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-fe-base
```

## Usage

Create a new project directory and `cd` into it:

```bash
mkdir my-new-project && cd $_
```

Run the `fe-base` generator in your new directory:

```bash
yo fe-base
```

That's it! You have a basis to build your project from.
Open the directory in your text editor and start building.
